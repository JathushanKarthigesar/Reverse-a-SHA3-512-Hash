# Reverse-a-SHA3-512-Hash
Reverse a SHA3-512 Hash (reverse_Hash.txt)

Used rainbow attack to find out the word that is equal to the SHA3-512 Hash in reverse_Hash.txt

pass.txt -> Words extracted from rockyou.txt, a wordlist that contains over 14 million password lists that leaked in a data breach. Contents in this file are from rockyou-55.txt.
revHash.py -> Algorithm created to perform rainbow attack. 
trial.txt -> trial file used to test if the code in revHash.py works, before testing the code on pass.txt
